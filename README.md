**Abstract:**   
Biological actions of insulin regulate glucose metabolism and other essential
physiological functions. Binding of insulin to its cell surface receptor
initiates signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses. Thus,
it is of great interest to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin
receptor binding kinetics. Interestingly, negative cooperative interactions
are observed at high insulin concentrations while positive cooperativity may
be present at low insulin concentrations. Clearly, insulin receptor binding
kinetics cannot be simply explained by a classical bimolecular reaction.
Mature insulin receptors have a dimeric structure capable of binding two
molecules of insulin. The binding affinity of the receptor for the second
insulin molecule is significantly lower than for the first bound insulin
molecule. In addition, insulin receptor aggregation occurs in response to
ligand binding and aggregation may also influence binding kinetics. In this
study, we develop a mathematical model for insulin receptor binding kinetics
that explicitly represents the divalent nature of the insulin receptor and
incorporates receptor aggregation into the kinetic model. Model parameters are
based upon published data where available. Computer simulations with our model
are capable of reproducing both negative and positive cooperativity at the
appropriate insulin concentrations. This model may be a useful tool for
helping to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin receptor binding and
the coupling of receptor binding to downstream signaling events.
